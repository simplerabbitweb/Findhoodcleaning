        <h1>How to Hire a Hood Cleaning Company (Without Getting Ripped Off)</h1>
    </div>
</section>

<div class="chrome-divider"></div>

<div class="article-body">
    <div class="article-content">
            <p>Not all hood cleaning companies do the same quality of work. Some will show up, wipe down the visible parts of your hood, slap a sticker on it, and charge you full price for what amounts to a half job. The grease hiding in your ducts and around your rooftop fan stays right where it is.</p>
            <p>Here's how to tell the difference between a company that actually does the work and one that's just going through the motions.</p>
            <h2>Start With Certifications</h2>
            <p>The gold standard in this industry is IKECA certification. IKECA stands for the International Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning Association, and they set the professional standards for commercial kitchen exhaust cleaning. A company that's IKECA certified has been trained on proper cleaning procedures, safety protocols, and NFPA 96 compliance.</p>
            <p>Not every good company is IKECA certified, but it's a strong signal that they take the work seriously. At minimum, ask if their technicians have been professionally trained and whether the company is familiar with NFPA 96 requirements.</p>
            <p>If they don't know what NFPA 96 is, that tells you everything you need to know.</p>
            <h2>Ask What They Actually Clean</h2>
            <p>This is where a lot of restaurant owners get burned. A cheap quote often means a partial cleaning. Here's what a full, compliant cleaning should cover:</p>
            <p>The hood canopy, including interior surfaces, grease gutters, and filter tracks. All grease filters, removed, degreased, and inspected. The entire duct run from the hood through the building to the rooftop. The exhaust fan, including blades, housing, and motor area. Any access panels, clean-out doors, or inspection ports.</p>
            <p>If a company quotes you significantly less than their competitors, ask them to list exactly what's included. Chances are they're skipping the ductwork or the rooftop fan, which are the parts where dangerous grease buildup actually happens.</p>
            <h2>Check Their Insurance</h2>
            <p>This one is non-negotiable. Hood cleaning involves climbing on roofs, working with chemicals, and operating in your kitchen around expensive equipment. If something goes wrong and the company doesn't have insurance, you're on the hook.</p>
            <p>At minimum, they should carry general liability insurance and workers' compensation. Ask to see a certificate of insurance before they start work. Any professional company will have this ready to go.</p>
            <h2>Ask About Their Process</h2>
            <p>A good company will walk you through how they work before they start. Generally, a professional hood cleaning goes something like this:</p>
            <p>A lead technician assesses the kitchen and identifies what needs attention. The crew covers your cooking equipment and surrounding areas with plastic to protect against cleaning chemicals and runoff. They apply commercial-grade degreaser (which should be food-safe) to all surfaces. Every component is scrubbed and cleaned to bare metal. The ductwork is accessed through panels or from the rooftop and cleaned throughout. The exhaust fan is opened, cleaned, and reassembled. Everything is dried, filters are reinstalled, and the work area is cleaned up. Photos are taken and a service report is generated.</p>
            <p>If a company can't explain their process or seems vague about it, that's a red flag.</p>
            <h2>Demand Documentation</h2>
            <p>After every cleaning, you should receive a certification sticker placed on the hood. This sticker shows the date of cleaning, the company name, and when the next service is due. Fire inspectors look for this sticker first.</p>
            <p>You should also get a written service report that details what was cleaned, the condition of the system, any issues they found (like damaged ductwork or a fan that needs repair), and before-and-after photos.</p>
            <p>This documentation is your proof of compliance. Without it, you have no way to demonstrate to an inspector or your insurance company that the work was done. Keep every report on file.</p>
            <h2>Get Multiple Quotes (But Don't Just Pick the Cheapest)</h2>
            <p>It's smart to get two or three quotes so you have a sense of what the going rate is in your area. Prices vary depending on the size of your system, how long it's been since the last cleaning, and where you're located.</p>
            <p>But if one quote comes in dramatically lower than the others, be cautious. That usually means they're cutting corners somewhere. A $200 cleaning on a system that other companies are quoting at $500-700 should raise questions about what's being skipped.</p>
            <p>The right price is the one that covers a thorough, documented cleaning of the entire system. Think of it as insurance against a fire that could shut down your business permanently.</p>
            <h2>Watch Out for These Red Flags</h2>
            <p>There are some warning signs that a hood cleaning company isn't worth your time:</p>
            <p>They can't provide proof of insurance. They don't know what NFPA 96 is or can't discuss it. They don't provide before-and-after photos. They quote a price without asking about the size of your system. They only clean the hood canopy and filters, not the ducts and fan. They don't leave a certification sticker or written report. They want to work during your peak hours without discussing scheduling. They pressure you into signing a long-term contract before you've seen their work.</p>
            <h2>When to Schedule</h2>
            <p>Most hood cleaning companies work during off-hours so they don't disrupt your service. Late nights and early mornings before prep starts are the most common windows. A good company will work with your schedule and be flexible about timing.</p>
            <p>Plan ahead. The best companies in your area book up, especially around inspection season. Don't wait until you get a notice from the fire marshal to start looking.</p>
